/*
A C wrapper to get proper SDL initialisation on mac. From MACOSX in the
SDL haskell package:

  SDL uses Objective-C and Cocoa to open a UI window; this means that
  Cocoa must be initialized, and in particular, an NSAutoReleasePool be in
  place.  This initialization is done in libSDLmain.  For
  C/C++/Objective-C programs, libSDLmain #defines the developer's main to
  be SDL_main and piggy backs SDL_main onto it's own Cocoa main, using the
  C preprocessor and abusing the linker.  Of course, this technique will
  never work for Haskell: there is no clean entry point to a Haskell
  runtime in this fashion.
  ...  
  [MainRenamed.hs] imports Main and foreign-exports Main.main as haskell_main
  to be able to call it from C. [mainc.c] includes SDL.h and contains a
  main function to make the preprocessor magic of SDL happen. The C main
  function initializes the GHC RTS and calls haskell_main from
  [MainRenamed.hs] which is Main.main in disguise.  The Makefile then uses
  ghc --make to link our objects with the GHC RTS and SDL.
